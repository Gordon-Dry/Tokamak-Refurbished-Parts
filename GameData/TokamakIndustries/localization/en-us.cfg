		// ********** Part: centrifugeSmall

		#LOC_toka_centrifugeSmall_description = Recent studies show that long-time exposure to micro gravity has negative effects on the health of kerbals. This feasible solution, inspired by a hamster wheel, is a spinning habitat that generates artificial gravity through centripetal force. EVA-activity around the spinning wheel is classified as 'semi-lethal'.

		// ********** Part: kadeptHSlarge

		#LOC_toka_kadeptHSlarge_description = The Kanvas And Duct-tape Entry Protection Thing (KADEPT) designed by DennyTX Ltd is a very light folding heat shield made of high-tech Mystery Goo impregnated fabric, and not just an unusually bulky umbrella. In either case, the KADEPT's ability to unfold allows you to produce a lot of drag for your aerobraking needs in a surprisingly light package. It is however considerably weaker than a conventional shield, so not recommended for high velocities in thick atmostpheres, or indeed for any other use. This version is 5m stowed, and about 8m extended.

		// ********** Part: TIdryworkshop

		// ********** Part: TIinflato1

		#LOC_toka_TIinflato1_description = After the Kerbin-renowned Porkworks was acquired by C7 Aerospace, they abandoned their Inflato product line to focus almost entirely on spaceplane parts. This left warehouses full of almost perfectly good giant space balloons gathering dust. Tokamak Industries was able to acquire them at closeout prices, and we pass the savings on to you! The PA550 was already a mature design, so we simply had to dust it off, update the inflation mechanisms, and possibly remember to check for leaks. It offers an unprecedented amount of elbow room for recreation, guaranteed to prevent your Kerbals from getting grumpy and mutinous on long stays in space. (Warranty void if used in space or extrakerbal planetary surfaces)

		#LOC_toka_TIinflato2_description = After the Kerbin-renowned Porkworks was acquired by C7 Aerospace, they abandoned their Inflato product line to focus almost entirely on spaceplane parts. This left warehouses full of almost perfectly good giant space balloons gathering dust. Tokamak Industries was able to acquire them at closeout prices, and we pass the savings on to you! When we got our hands these, they were just mostly empty shells with 30mï¿½ of exciting possibilities. Ignoring those possibilities, the PA330 has been fitted out as a workshop instead. It can hold up to 6 Kerbals with enough elbow room for them to work, but you will want to find somewhere else for them to spend their off time if you are not a fan of mutiny. There was even enough room left over to throw in some surplus life support recycling equipment.

This left warehouses full of almost perfectly good giant space balloons gathering dust. Tokamak Industries was able to acquire them at closeout prices, and we pass the savings on to you! Like the PA330, the "Feasible Landable Advanced Technology" Inflato module was just an empty shell with an excess of docking ports. Unlike the PA330, it was also annoyingly small, so a command console and a worktable were all that would fit in it when stowed. At least it's roomy when inflated, and quite light for a 4 Kerbal pod. We are fairly sure we cleared out all of the spiders.

		// ********** Part: TImunoxShuttle

		#LOC_toka_TImunoxShuttle_description = A couple of sleek hulls with mount points about them were found in the warehouses among the abandoned inflatables. Their intended purpose went on as lost files and a complete unknown but fortunately they were kept around. Recently, someone finally had a great idea, the idea to make service shuttles out of them, and have them carry a lot of food and kerbals at once.
