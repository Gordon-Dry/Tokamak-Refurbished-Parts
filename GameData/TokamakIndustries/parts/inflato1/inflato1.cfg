	description = #LOC_toka_TIinflato1_description // #TIinflato1_description = After the Kerbin-renowned Porkworks was acquired by C7 Aerospace, they abandoned their Inflato product line to focus almost entirely on spaceplane parts. This left warehouses full of almost perfectly good giant space balloons gathering dust. Tokamak Industries was able to acquire them at closeout prices, and we pass the savings on to you! The PA550 was already a mature design, so we simply had to dust it off, update the inflation mechanisms, and possibly remember to check for leaks. It offers an unprecedented amount of elbow room for recreation, guaranteed to prevent your Kerbals from getting grumpy and mutinous on long stays in space. (Warranty void if used in space or extrakerbal planetary surfaces)
